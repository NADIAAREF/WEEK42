                <h1>3 Steps to Create an Outstanding Marketing Plan</h1>
                <p>You should. Without an annual marketing plan, things can get messy — and it's nearly impossible to put a number on the budget you'll need to secure for the projects, hiring, and outsourcing you'll encounter over the course of a year if you don't have a plan. 

                    Marketing plans can get quite granular to reflect the industry you're in, whether you're selling to consumers (B2C) or other businesses (B2B), and how big your digital presence is. Nonetheless, here are the elements every effective marketing plan includes:
                    </p>
                    <h2>1.Business Summary </h2>
                    <p>In a marketing plan, your Business Summary is exactly what it sounds like: a summary of the organization. This includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The company name</li>
                        <li>Where it's headquartered</li>
                        <li>Its mission statement</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h2>2.Business Initiatives</h2> 
                      <p>
                        The Business Initiatives element of a marketing plan helps you segment the various goals of your department. Be careful not to include big-picture company initiatives, which you'd normally find in a business plan. This section of your marketing plan should outline the projects that are specific to marketing. You'll also describe the goals of those projects and how those goals will be measured.

                      </p>
                      <h2>3.Customer Analysis</h2>
                      <p>
                          Here's where you'll conduct some basic market research. If your company has already done a thorough market research study, this section of your marketing plan might be easier to put together.Ultimately, this element of your marketing plan will help you describe the industry you're selling to and your buyer persona. A buyer persona is a semi-fictional description of your ideal customer, focusing on traits like:

                      </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Age</li>
                        <li>Location</li>
                        <li>Title</li>
                        <li>Goals</li>
                        <li>Personal challenge</li>
                        <li>Pains</li>
                        <li>Triggering events</li>
                      </ul>

                <h1>It's All About the Right Time.</h1>
                <p>Marketing, marketing and marketing. Huh, it never was an easy job. Marketing at right time is crucial. Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed the rise of real-time marketing—marketing that’s aimed at customers at the moment they’re taking action, or that’s tied to trends or events.
                </p>
                <h2>Focus on resonance—not just relevance </h2>
                <P>To effectively execute right-time marketing, you need to understand that your marketing efforts don’t happen in a vacuum. 
                    You need to identify the following:
                </P>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>The right person: </b> are you trying to convert? First-time customers? Repeat clients? How much does t</li>
                    <li><b>The right channel: </b>How will you reach out to the right person? Do they prefer to purchase in an offline shop or via an online store? Do they contact you via email or on social media?
                    </li>
                    <li><b>The right moment: </b>Is the right person responding to a coupon or discount? Have they recently made a similar purchase?
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  </div>
            </div>
